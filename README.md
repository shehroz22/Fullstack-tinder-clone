# MERN-tinder-clone
So in this project i have cloned tinder app using MERN stack.
The front-end is done by using react while the data to be shown was hard coded.
I didnt fetch data from API because the purpose was to create my own database save  data in it and use that in frontend.
for the backend i have used mongodb for data base
Node js for backend javascript framework
Express js for server side javascript
mongoose to coonect mongodb for easy connection
The front end is deployed using firebase
While the backend is deployed using heroku
